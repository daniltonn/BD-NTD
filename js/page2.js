Amity Institute of Information Technology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, Noida, India.</p> <h2>Abstract</h2> <p>The use of augmented reality (AR) technology in education has increased recently and provides similar and interactive learning experiences that go beyond traditional education. AR apps, in particular, have the potential to enhance learning by giving students the opportunity to explore complex scientific concepts in a positive and interesting way. To provide the best learning experience, this article examines the design and implementation of a virtual reality application designed for science education. He does this by using the power of the Union and Vuforia. By integrating virtual objects into the physical world, virtual reality classrooms can help students see complex science concepts more clearly and in depth, thus promoting learning about information and understanding concepts. The program uses design to make experiments, 3D models, and data points based on the science curriculum to engage students of all ages and ability levels. This study examines the development process of virtual reality applications, including the integration of knowledge, performance evaluation, and investigation of changes in technology in science education. This study focuses on the role of AR technology in modernizing educational technology and influencing the educational process in the digital age through a comprehensive analysis of the design process and strategies used. © 2026, Greater Mekong Subregion Academic and Research Network, Asian Institute of Technology.
