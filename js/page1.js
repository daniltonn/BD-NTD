Larger space does not promote divergent thinking, impair convergent thinking or defocus attention in physical and virtual environments. Thinking Skills and Creativity, 52, 101959. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2025.101959 </p> <h2>Abstract</h2> <p>Prior research has suggested that larger spaces might enhance creative performance in divergent thinking tasks. To further investigate this spatial effect and elucidate the underlying mechanism, the current study used a controlled manipulation of space size. We aimed at replicating the influence of space size on divergent and convergent thinking, while also examining defocused attention as a potential underlying mechanism through the Auditory Stroop Task. In Experiment 1, participants performed the Alternate Uses Task, Remote Association Task, and Auditory Stroop Task in both large and small physical spaces. Results indicated no significant differences in task performance across spatial conditions, with Bayesian analyses strongly supporting the null hypothesis. Experiment 2 employed a virtual reality environment, presenting participants with large and small virtual rooms where they completed the same three cognitive tasks using a virtual reality headset. Findings demonstrated higher novelty scores in divergent thinking in the smaller (vs. larger) virtual space, but no significant differences in other tasks. Bayesian analyses again favored the null hypothesis. Overall, the findings of the two experiments suggest that space size, whether manipulated in the physical or virtual environment, does not influence divergent thinking, convergent thinking, or defocused attention. The implications of these findings on embodied metaphor and defocused attention accounts are discussed. © 2025</p>";
